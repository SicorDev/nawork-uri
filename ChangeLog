2.1.10:: FIX: Editors could not edit urls nor create redirects because they were saved on pid 0: Different storage page can be set in ext conf and can be updated via ext update functionality

2.1.9 :: FIX: Params and params hash were not written to database when creating a new url

2.1.8 :: FIX: Improved performance by better code and additional index on the db table for improving cache reading speed

2.1.7 :: FIX: Redirect dropped query params e.g. for ga tracking

2.1.6 :: FIX: Introduced transformation cache to avoid multiple db lookups for the same parameter value, this increases performance
	  :: FIX: Transliteration did not work correctly with libiconv's implementation instead of glibc's so we add an option for transliterateing any character to another character, see default config

2.1.5 :: FIX: Cache time was 30 seconds, that was much too low. Cache time is now read from pages or from config.cache_period as fallback, final fallback is 86400
	  :: FIX: Transliteration of url was based on some hard coded characters, now iconv is used. The locale from config.locale_all is used. Fallback is the setting in ext conf or en_US

2.1.4 :: FIX: Field pid must not be converted to tinyint, that leads to pid that are max 127 so the page where corrupted
	  :: CLEANUP: Remove some debugging commands

2.1.3 :: FIX: Constraints to select a url from the database was wrong when no be user was locked in, so the url could never be found

2.1.2 :: FIX: "$" was missing before "url" when giving it to the finalizeUrl function after generating the url

2.1.1 :: FIX: Redirect after call via parameter form is now finalized and redirected by helper class

2.1.0 :: Added redirect feature:
	  :: * editors can create redirects for e.g. old pages, advertisements or special events
	  :: * paths are not overwritten anymore on change, old ones are changed to redirects and new ones are created, redirect urls are reused if the path is needed again
	  :: * urls are of type redirect when created manually, type field is not shown in tce form to avoid mistakes by editors
	  :: Sticky is renamed to locked
	  :: FIX: Records are not copied with pages anymore because the pid field is 0, we now use the field page_uid to store the pid
	  :: FIX: A "+" in a page title caused 404 errors, so we removed it from the uri when encoding so we can not get problems
	  :: FIX: The preview did not work anymore because we check if the page can be shown (hidden, starttime, endtime), this check is now deactivated when a be user is logged in
	  :: Added update script to process the database changes to make the system work as expected
	  :: Made backend module more useable:
	  :: * Buttons in the rows are gone and now placed in the top toolbar
	  :: * edit and lock buttons are only available if one url is selected
	  :: * delete button is available if at least one url is selected, this allows multiple deletion
	  :: * deletion must be confirmed
	  :: * Added filters to the backend module: Choose between locked, unlocked or all urls, filter by path
	  :: * Show normal urls, old urls or redirects
	  :: * FIX: jumping back to the first page after a url is locked or deleted does not happend anymore
	  :: * FIX: selected rows are now visible
	  :: Updated readme and todos

2.0.3 :: [FIX] After hook processing the url must be checked if the absRefPrefix should be prepended

2.0.2 :: Add the ability to use mm queries in nawork_uri conf

2.0.1 :: Add hooks for post processing parameter before transformation and post processing the url after transformation
