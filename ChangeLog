2.1.29:
* FIX: Wrong sql query syntax in tx_naworkuri_cache::unique

2.1.28:
* FIX: Missing parameters after explode and implode: explode_parameters and implode_parameters can handle array valued parameters now
* FIX: Float values were shown with comma instead of point due to setlocale(LC_ALL,...): We don't set LC_ALL anymore
* FIX: Unit tests does not fit the current development state: Changed unit tests and added several data sets

2.1.27
* FIX: Cache can not be cleared: Removes deleted field from clear cache query, that was removed in 2.1.17
* FIX: Urls are not converted to old urls: Corrects the spelling mistake in the page id parameter, parameter hash must not be encoded for hashing
* FIX: Extension configuration containes reference to cool uri config file: Changes the description for the xml path configuration
* FIX: Queries are stored for debugging: Disables the storing of queries
* FIX: Removes unnecessary line in function tx_naworkuri_cache::setTimeout that set the timeout to 0

2.1.26
* FIX: The interface backend_cacheActionsHook wasn't autoloaded anymore in 4.7

2.1.25
* FIX: Set L param as string, this led to wrong cHashes
* FIX: Recalculate cHash to avoid the same url with another cHash to generated because of encoded vs. non-encoded parameters, e.g. from crawler

2.1.24
* FIX: Remove table alias from query in function for finding old url, that caused the url not to be found when used in multidomain mode

2.1.23
* FIX: an empty uri part was returned if a record was not available in default language

2.1.22
* FIX: missing try-catch around uri generation in redirect2Uri function, the exception is caught and logged to be log
* FIX: urlencoding is now correct when the path cannot be encoded, the parameter names must not be encoded

2.1.21
* FIX: Use limit parameter for query when looking for urls based on parameter hash in unique function to avoid fetching unknown numbers of records and possibly run into the php memory limit

2.1.20
* FIX: Removed the deleted field of url table from the cache's sql queries. This caused sql errors if the field was removed from database due to current database updates

2.1.19
* FIX: if a website was called with, e.g. host/?type=123 and type=123 is not in config it did endless redirects due to return the same url over and over again
       now the return url is compared to the initial one and the redirect is only made if they are different

2.1.18
* FIX: fixed some bugs that avoid the ext_update script to work properly
* FIX: removed the eval from the path field, to manually make paths without the appendix

2.1.17
* FIX: Additional index on url table on the column hash_path which increases the unique function's speed
* FIX: Path segment in overlay was only 30 chars long, is now the same as for pages (64 chars)
* FIX: Unique key on the columns domain,path
* FIX: Function for imploding the parameters now has a parameter to raw url encode the parameters, must be set to false for when imploding the db insert
* FIX: Old url must be updated with new data and not just touched
* FIX: When creating the url and a db error occurs an exception is thrown
* FIX: Parameters are now filtered before looking up existing url, so also partially transformed urls are found
* FIX: Alias is resolved to the id before any processing is done
* FIX: Exceptions are caught and logged to be log
* FIX: Deleted flag is not used anymore, urls are deleted complete from database
* FIX: Unique function is now more efficient: It checks if a url already exists, if yes it looks for a url based on the parameter set, if the "original_path" matches the generated one, this path is return, else it tries to make the url unique
* FIX: path before unique process is now saved as "original_path" to use it for comparison in unique method
* FIX: Ajax code for deleting urls now deletes the urls instead of setting them to deleted=1
* FIX: BE module has the option to show all urls
* FIX: URLs can be placed on root page and in the page tree
* FIX: Admins can choose the type of url when creating one manually, can be enable also for editors

2.1.16
* FIX: Renamed class name for clear cache menu to be compatible with TYPO3 4.4

2.1.15
* FIX: domain condition in query for finding existant url contained table alias "u" which was not used anymore, so existant urls could not be found in multidomain setups

2.1.14
* FIX: Cleaner code for handling of old urls
* FEATURE: Clean URL cache from the backend clear cache menu
* FIX: Added russian transliterations in default config

2.1.13
* FIX: Removed the language parent and diffsource completely from tca, were still in ext_tables.php

2.1.12
* FIX: Hash fields were exclude fields so editors could not create urls
* FIX: SQL query for finding cached urls was wrong when in single domain mode
* FIX: l18n_parent and l18n_diffsource were still in showRecordFieldList, leading to error messages when saving a url

2.1.11
* FIX: Domain is now a select box, to make it easier for editors
* FEATURE: Add hook for pre processing the redirect (type 2) record

2.1.10
* FIX: Editors could not edit urls nor create redirects because they were saved on pid 0: Different storage page can be set in ext conf and can be updated via ext update functionality

2.1.9
* FIX: Params and params hash were not written to database when creating a new url

2.1.8
* FIX: Improved performance by better code and additional index on the db table for improving cache reading speed

2.1.7
* FIX: Redirect dropped query params e.g. for ga tracking

2.1.6
* FIX: Introduced transformation cache to avoid multiple db lookups for the same parameter value, this increases performance
* FIX: Transliteration did not work correctly with libiconv's implementation instead of glibc's so we add an option for transliterateing any character to another character, see default config

2.1.5
* FIX: Cache time was 30 seconds, that was much too low. Cache time is now read from pages or from config.cache_period as fallback, final fallback is 86400
* FIX: Transliteration of url was based on some hard coded characters, now iconv is used. The locale from config.locale_all is used. Fallback is the setting in ext conf or en_US

2.1.4
* FIX: Field pid must not be converted to tinyint, that leads to pid that are max 127 so the page where corrupted
* CLEANUP: Remove some debugging commands

2.1.3
* FIX: Constraints to select a url from the database was wrong when no be user was locked in, so the url could never be found

2.1.2
* FIX: "$" was missing before "url" when giving it to the finalizeUrl function after generating the url

2.1.1
* FIX: Redirect after call via parameter form is now finalized and redirected by helper class

2.1.0
* Added redirect feature:
  * editors can create redirects for e.g. old pages, advertisements or special events
  * paths are not overwritten anymore on change, old ones are changed to redirects and new ones are created, redirect urls are reused if the path is needed again
  * urls are of type redirect when created manually, type field is not shown in tce form to avoid mistakes by editors
* Sticky is renamed to locked
* FIX: Records are not copied with pages anymore because the pid field is 0, we now use the field page_uid to store the pid
* FIX: A "+" in a page title caused 404 errors, so we removed it from the uri when encoding so we can not get problems
* FIX: The preview did not work anymore because we check if the page can be shown (hidden, starttime, endtime), this check is now deactivated when a be user is logged in
* Added update script to process the database changes to make the system work as expected
* Made backend module more useable:
  * Buttons in the rows are gone and now placed in the top toolbar
  * edit and lock buttons are only available if one url is selected
  * delete button is available if at least one url is selected, this allows multiple deletion
  * deletion must be confirmed
  * Added filters to the backend module: Choose between locked, unlocked or all urls, filter by path
  * Show normal urls, old urls or redirects
  * FIX: jumping back to the first page after a url is locked or deleted does not happend anymore

* Add the ability to use mm queries in nawork_uri conf

2.0.1
* Add hooks for post processing parameter before transformation and post processing the url after transformation
