2.1.0 :: Added redirect feature:
	  :: * editors can create redirects for e.g. old pages, advertisements or special events
	  :: * paths are not overwritten anymore on change, old ones are changed to redirects and new ones are created, redirect urls are reused if the path is needed again
	  :: * urls are of type redirect when created manually, type field is not shown in tce form to avoid mistakes by editors
	  :: Sticky is renamed to locked
	  :: FIX: Records are not copied with pages anymore because the pid field is 0, we now use the field page_uid to store the pid
	  :: FIX: A "+" in a page title caused 404 errors, so we removed it from the uri when encoding so we can not get problems
	  :: FIX: The preview did not work anymore because we check if the page can be shown (hidden, starttime, endtime), this check is now deactivated when a be user is logged in
	  :: Added update script to process the database changes to make the system work as expected
	  :: Made backend module more useable:
	  :: * Buttons in the rows are gone and now placed in the top toolbar
	  :: * edit and lock buttons are only available if one url is selected
	  :: * delete button is available if at least one url is selected, this allows multiple deletion
	  :: * deletion must be confirmed
	  :: * Added filters to the backend module: Choose between locked, unlocked or all urls, filter by path
	  :: * Show normal urls, old urls or redirects
	  :: * FIX: jumping back to the first page after a url is locked or deleted does not happend anymore
	  :: * FIX: selected rows are now visible
	  :: Updated readme and todos
